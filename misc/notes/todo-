find a 3d math library
  glMatrix seems good

figure out how to get shaders to be separate files

fast (easy to follow) workflows are more important than automatic

for "brightness of a light source" or material props, dont use 0-1 scales
  0-100 or 0-255 are better

what if you could draw UVs separatly and assign them to faces
  works well for lopoly

load data as shader params ie textures
  kindof the 'asset' idea if that data is stored as part of the object

verts can have multiple UV coords at the same location based on face
  basically for UVs, faces need to be prioritized and you may have many verts
  that have the same position with different uv coords
  drawing needs to be done with index based triangle drawing

keybinds
  tool select
    move
    rotate
    scale
    extrude
  editor settings
    3d
      perspective/ortho
      wireframe, solid, rendered
      vert/edge/face/object selection
    animator
    uv
  switch between views

'vertex groups'
  used for
    per-vertex material
    vertex groups for selection
    bones/weights
  can be solved by just using separate objects for things
    let users edit multiple objects at once

treat the editor camera as an actual in-scene camera

'modifiers'
  i only ever use mirror
    possibly 'array' (with the origin point)
  why would you need modifiers if theres geometry nodes now

  mirror is a tool setting

for now dont worry about custom shaders

3d editor
  scene data shouldnt be put in a store
    reactivity can be built into the editor, or the component
      editor->ui
        actions done in the editor can trigger signals
        take into account currently selected objects
      ui->editor
        these can be derived setters that set UI state and editor state
