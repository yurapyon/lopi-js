find a 3d math library
  glMatrix seems good

figure out how to get shaders to be separate files

fast (easy to follow) workflows are more important than automatic

for "brightness of a light source" or material props, dont use 0-1 scales
  0-100 or 0-255 are better

what if you could draw UVs separatly and assign them to faces
  works well for lopoly

load data as shader params ie textures
  kindof the 'asset' idea if that data is stored as part of the object

verts can have multiple UV coords at the same location based on face
  basically for UVs, faces need to be prioritized and you may have many verts
  that have the same position with different uv coords
  drawing needs to be done with index based triangle drawing
