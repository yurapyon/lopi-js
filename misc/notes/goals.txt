use cases
  rendering scenes/art
  making models for vrchat/vtuber models
  making assets for games
    models, shaders
    potentially could be used as a scene editor

driving ideas
  make 3d as easy as 2d
    obvious to use
    focused workflow and UI
  good documentation (in-app ?)
  start business with something good
    move on to
      maru              (video art/motion graphics editor)
      flash replacement (big project but cool)

---

fast (easy to follow) workflows are more important than automated
