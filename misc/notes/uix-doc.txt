treat the editor camera as an actual in-scene camera

for "brightness of a light source" or material props, dont use 0-1 scales
  0-100 or 0-255 are better

apex style mousewheel thing

instead of an inspector as a component on the sidebar
could pop up 'fine tune position/rotation/scale' inputs
  either
    - in a status bar
    - a popup on top of the 3d editor itself
    - in the heiarchy itself as a subcomponent of each scene object
      root
        camera
          position
          rotation
          scale
          ...etc...
        mesh

      could 'pin' rows so they show up in thier own section at the top
      could be useful for animations if you could select vec3s from the heiarchy view
